# Changelog

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-20

### ✨ Features
- **Child-reply notification banner is back in the web UI** — when an employee (child) session replies, the parent session's chat shows a centered system banner again (live via the `session:notification` WS event, and on history reload). It was removed by the v0.13.0 "nuke notifications" cleanup along with the bell.

### 🪄 Polish
- **Dual-audience callback messages** — the child-reply notification is now decoupled: the parent **engine** (e.g. the COO) receives a full-context message with the child session id and API pointers to follow up, while the **web UI** shows a clean, simplified banner (`📩 <employee> replied` + a tidy preview) instead of the old noisy `GET /api/sessions/…?last=N` / `Preview:` blob. The gateway persists + emits the clean version for display and runs the engine on the full one.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-20

### 🪄 Docs
- **Align delegation guidance with restored callbacks** — the `template/CLAUDE.md`, `template/AGENTS.md`, and the runtime-injected delegation protocol (`context.ts`) disagreed about whether the gateway notifies a parent session: the templates still said "auto-notify, never poll" while `context.ts` (post-nuke) said "no callback, poll." Now that v0.13.1 restored the callback, all three describe the same **hybrid** model: the gateway wakes you on a child reply, with polling as a fallback so a missed callback never leaves a parent idle.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-20

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Restore parent-session callbacks** — the "nuke notifications" cleanup (v0.13.0) was meant to remove only the web notification bell, but it also stripped the backend mechanism that wakes a parent session when a child session replies. Child/employee sessions were finishing without ever notifying their parent/COO session, so delegated work returned silently and had to be polled for manually. Restores `notifyParentSession` and the `role:"notification"` message path (including the "don't interrupt a running parent turn" guard), `Employee.alwaysNotify`, `JinnConfig.notifications`, and the `PATCH /api/org/employees/:name` endpoint. The web bell UI stays removed.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-18

### ✨ Features
- **Interactive Claude engine** — every Claude turn (cron, connectors, web Chat, web CLI) now runs the real interactive `claude` TUI inside a node-pty pseudo-terminal. Bills as `cc_entrypoint=cli`, preserving Max subscription past Anthropic's June 15, 2026 cutoff that ends `claude -p` subsidy.
- **Hook-driven turn boundaries** — per-session `--settings` file registers Claude Code's SessionStart/Stop/StopFailure/PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks; a tiny `hook-relay.mjs` POSTs each event back to the daemon over loopback so turn lifecycle is detected without screen-scraping.
- **Per-session KEEP ALIVE control** — toggle in web UI decides whether a PTY survives across turns (snappy follow-ups, warm context) or is reaped after the grace window. Orphan PTYs reaped on daemon restart.
- **Web Chat ↔ CLI toggle per session** — `xterm.js` view of the live PTY (CLI mode) or parsed delta stream (Chat mode), persisted per session. One process, one billing event for either view.
- **Recently-viewed chat keep-alive cache** — chats stay mounted in the web UI for instant switching.
- **GatewayProvider consolidation** — single WebSocket replaces 5–7 per page in the web UI.

### ⚡ Performance
- **8–20s daemon GET latency → <100ms** during active turns. Root causes fixed:
  - Ring-buffer PTY scrollback (was O(N) string realloc per data chunk → O(1) chunk-list ring)
  - Transcript backfill made async + transactional (was sync `readFileSync` + N inserts per GET)
  - Async transcript tail with long-lived `FileHandle` (was sync `statSync`+`openSync`+`readSync` per file-watch event)
- **Web event-storm fix** — `events` array narrowed to frames consumers actually filter on; high-frequency consumers migrated to direct `subscribe()` callbacks.
- **rAF-coalesced xterm window resize**, `hasOutput` short-circuit, static-import for hook endpoint.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Tab status no longer goes stale** — chat tabs subscribe to session lifecycle events; blue "in progress" dot clears on completion and survives reload.
- **No more title flash on tab click** — `sessionMeta` now tagged with its owning sessionId; effect refuses to write stale meta onto the newly-selected tab.
- **Orphan tabs after sidebar delete** — `session:deleted` events now close matching tabs.
- **Reconcile persisted tabs on load** — drops orphans, normalizes stale `running` status against authoritative server state.
- **Rate-limit wait cancels on user stop** — was only catching `"error"` status, missed the `"idle"` user-initiated stop case.
- **Heartbeat clears after session delete** — no more `status:"running"` writes against deleted rows.
- **Hook endpoint hardening** — loopback check moved ahead of body read, 64 KB body cap, `crypto.timingSafeEqual` secret comparison, empty-secret bypass guard.
- **File-mode 0o600 on `gateway.json`, `--settings`, and `~/.claude.json`** — hook secret no longer world-readable on shared machines.
- **HookRegistry buffer GC** — periodic sweep evicts entries whose TTL expired; closes long-running memory leak.
- **`streams` map cleanup on PTY exit**, **kill-mid-paste race closed** (`turnStarted` before `injectPrompt`), **PTY-reset control frame** sent to xterm on respawn, **async-tailer fd nulled on read error**.

### 🪄 Docs
- New README section: **"How the Claude engine works under the hood"** — PTY, hooks, transcript tail, KEEP ALIVE, Chat/CLI duality, and why we moved off `claude -p` before the subscription cutoff.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### ✨ Features
- Connector abstraction layer — connectors declare capabilities (threading, reactions, edits, attachments) and health status
- `replyMessage()` vs `sendMessage()` split — proper thread-aware message routing
- CronConnector — cron jobs are now message sources routed through SessionManager (unified flow)
- Slack config options — `shareSessionInChannel`, `allowFrom` whitelist, `ignoreOldMessagesOnBoot`

- In-chat slash commands — `/cron list|run|enable|disable`, `/model <name>`, `/doctor`
- Runtime cron control — trigger/enable/disable jobs without restart
- Web UI: Slack settings toggles for new config options
- Web UI: Transport visibility — connector name, queue depth, transport state badges

### 🔧 Improvements
- Unified message routing — all sources flow through `SessionManager.route()` with uniform `IncomingMessage`
- Cron runner simplified — ~35% code reduction by delegating to SessionManager
- Capability-aware decorations — reactions/edits conditional on connector capabilities
- Config token masking — Slack tokens masked in `GET /api/config`
- Session queue monitoring — `getPendingCount()` and `getTransportState()`

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- Build pipeline — web UI bundled into gateway dist
- Test suite — threads, queue, and registry tests using Node.js native test runner
- DB migration — auto-adds connector/transport columns, backfills from legacy fields

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- `Connector` interface expanded with new required methods: `replyMessage()`, `getCapabilities()`, `getHealth()`, `reconstructTarget()`
- `IncomingMessage` and `Session` types have new required fields
- `GET /api/connectors` response shape changed from `string[]` to objects with capabilities
- `startScheduler()` now takes `SessionManager` instead of engine map
- `sendMessage()` no longer posts to threads — use `replyMessage()`
